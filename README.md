# Tendo-D20-card-connection-for-gui
This is a Python script that connects to a Tendo D20 card and shows live data as well as a live graph of data using the PyQtGraph library. It reads data from a CSV file to build a GUI interface that displays input and holding registers. It also allows the user to start and stop data logging.
